Percona XtraDB Cluster for Debian
=================================

Release tarballs can be downloaded from:

  http://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-XtraDB-Cluster/LATEST/source/

The intent is that this will eventually be parsable using uscan with a watch
file; for the time being please run:

  ./debian/orig-tar.sh NEW <VERSION>

by hand to repack the tarball to remove bundled python code from other projects.
