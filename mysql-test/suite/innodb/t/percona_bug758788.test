# Bug #758788: mysql process crashes after setting innodb_dict_size
#
# With innodb_dict_size=1 in the .opt file, the 'FLUSH TABLES' command below
# above allows the eviction of the dict_table for t1 in the dict cache even
# though there is a lock held against it due to the INSERT and referenced
# from the transaction lock list. When the COMMIT comes along and tries to 
# clean up the transaction lock list, the reference to t1 that was locked 
# during the first INSERT is now completely invalid and can cause various
# assertions since it is now pointing to potentially reclaimed memory.
#
SET SESSION AUTOCOMMIT=0;

CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT) ENGINE=INNODB;
CREATE TABLE t2 (c1 INT) ENGINE=INNODB;
INSERT INTO t1(c1) VALUES(1);
FLUSH TABLES;
INSERT INTO t2(c1) VALUES(1);
COMMIT;

DROP TABLE t2;
DROP TABLE t1;
